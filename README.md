# NFLReverseDraft

This code pulls down draft selections from ProFootball Reference and then helps compare each team's draft to a perfect draft, where a team selects the highest valued player avaiable at each pick.

This work is inspired by Namita Nandakumar's work on drafting perfectly in the NHL draft https://hockeygraphsdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/2-nandakumar-vanhac-slides.pdf


Currently value is judged by ProFootball Reference's Carrer Approximate Value (CarAV).
